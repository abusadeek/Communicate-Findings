Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system. In 2017, Ford GoBike will reinvent bike share in the Bay Area with 7,000 bikes across San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose. Ford GoBike is expected to become an essential part of the Bay Area's transportation network.

3. June is the most popular month for biking for both Customers and Subscribers.
4. Subscribers use the biking system mostly during working days (Mondays to Fridays) while Customers use the biking system mostly during weekends (Saturdays and Sundays).

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on member_age, member_gender and user_type. I started by introducing each variable one by one. Afterwards, I used the countplots of user_type across other variables to see the relationships that exist between them. I later used different plots to further compare each of the variables and I make sure it is clear that they're different between plots. I saw how age, gender and user type affect the FordGo biking system.
